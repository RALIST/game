- **Turn-Based Combat**: Inspired by Fallout 2, combat is turn-based, with each character having a certain number of action points to use each turn for movement, attacks, or using items.
- **Factions and Alliances**: Players can engage in combat on behalf of their faction, affecting their standing with the four factions and opening up or closing down quest lines and resources.

The combat system in the game is a strategic, turn-based system that draws heavy inspiration from the classic Fallout 2 game. This system is designed to offer players a tactical and immersive experience as they navigate the post-apocalyptic world. Here's a detailed breakdown of the combat mechanics:

### Turn-Based Combat

- **Action Points (AP):** Each character in the game is allocated a certain number of Action Points (AP) at the beginning of their turn. These points can be spent on various actions such as moving, attacking, using items, or special abilities. The number of APs a character has is influenced by their attributes and equipment.
- **Initiative:** The order in which characters take their turns is determined by their Initiative, a stat that can be influenced by the character's agility, perception, and certain items or buffs.
- **Cover and Positioning:** Players can strategically use the environment to their advantage. Taking cover behind objects can reduce incoming damage and increase your chances of survival.

### Factions and Alliances

- **Faction-Based Combat:** Players' actions in combat can affect their standing with the game's four factions. Engaging in combat on behalf of a faction can improve a player's reputation with that faction, while attacking its members can lead to a decrease in standing.
- **Alliances:** Players can form alliances with factions, leading to unique combat scenarios where they fight alongside NPC allies against common enemies. These alliances can also influence the availability of quests and resources.

### Combat Features

- **Special Moves and Critical Hits:** Characters can perform special moves that consume more AP but offer powerful effects, such as stunning an enemy or dealing extra damage. Critical hits are random, high-damage attacks that can turn the tide of battle.
- **Environmental Hazards:** Some combat arenas feature environmental hazards, such as explosive barrels or radioactive zones, which can be used strategically to gain an advantage.
- **Stealth and Ambushes:** Players can use stealth to avoid combat or initiate ambushes, granting them the first strike and potential bonuses to damage.

### Equipment and Abilities

- **Weapons and Armor:** A wide range of weapons and armor is available, each with its own AP cost and effects. Choosing the right equipment for your character's build and the situation is crucial for success.
- **Abilities and Perks:** Characters can learn abilities and perks that offer new combat options, such as healing, buffing allies, or debuffing enemies. These abilities can significantly impact the outcome of a fight.

The combat system in the game is designed to be deep and engaging, offering players a variety of strategies to explore. Whether you prefer a direct approach, using brute force to overpower your enemies, or a more tactical style, utilizing the environment and special abilities, the game's combat system has something to offer.
